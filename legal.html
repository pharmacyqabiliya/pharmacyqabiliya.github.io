We must receive any item you return to us within 28 calendar days of your notification to us of your intention to return the item(s). Orders cancelled under these Regulations are entitled to a refund of any standard postage paid for the delivery of your order, but you are responsible for any postage incurred in returning the items you wish to cancel to us. Unfortunately, we do not refund postage on return of part orders.<br />Items must be returned in the condition you received them, which includes keeping any hygiene seals in place. You will lose your right to return an item if you unseal a product that needs to be sealed for health or hygiene reasons.</p>
<p><strong>How to return items</strong><br />If your unwanted items weigh less than 5kg you can return them either by post or to your local Pharmacy Qabiliya store within 28 days of notifying us that you wish to return your items. Please ensure that you take your items and delivery note into the store. PayPal orders cannot be returned to store.<br />Please ensure that your package contains your completed returns form. A blank returns form is enclosed with your items.</p>
<p><strong>Returns to store</strong><br />To return items to your local Pharmacy Qabiliya store you will need to take your dispatch note, along with the card you used to make payment, to the store so we can process your return. You must return your item(s) within 28 days of receipt of your total order.</p>
<p><strong>Damaged and faulty items</strong><br />The Consumer Rights allows you to claim a refund on faulty goods within 30 days of receipt. In some cases we may offer to replace or repair the item free of charge: if the first repaired or replacement item we supply also turns out to be faulty then you can claim a refund at this point, which includes the price you paid for it plus any postal charges. This does not apply to items that have failed due to wear and tear. You may have additional manufacturer's warranties with some products, such as electrical items, giving you additional rights and you should check these carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds</strong><br />Your refund will be processed once we receive your returned items. Refunds are credited to the original card you paid with and will take 5-7 working days to be credited to your account, depending on your card provider.<br />We will refund any standard postage paid on orders returned in full. Unfortunately, we do not refund postage on return of part orders.</p>
<p><strong>PayPal refunds</strong><br />If you have paid for your order by PayPal, you can only return your order by post.</p>
<p><strong>Refund exclusions</strong><br />Unfortunately, you cannot return medicines, including prescription medicines, or anything that has a hygiene seal that has been broken. You have the right to reasonably inspect your items as you would in a shop, but you cannot return items that you have used, unless you are returning them because they are damaged or faulty.</p>
<p><strong>Liability</strong><br />Our maximum liability for our failure to fulfil an order that we are legally bound to fulfil will be limited to the price paid by you for that order.</p>
<p><strong>Health and safety warning</strong><br />Electrical products. Electrical products sold on this website are designed for use in Morocco. If supplied with a power adaptor it will be fitted with a MOR plug. They may not be suitable for use in other countries and you should check with the manufacturer before doing so.<br />You should read the instructions that come with the packaging before using the product and observe any specific warnings given by the manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Medical products</strong><br />Not all products are suitable for all medical ailments and, occasionally, their use may interfere with any treatment you are receiving or aggravate a condition. You should check with your GP before using any medical product.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness products</strong><br />Physical fitness products may not be suitable for use by some individuals. You should check with your GP before embarking on any fitness programme. Failure to do so may seriously damage your health.</p>
